## Task Tracking

DONE : FIX The delivery of the file (send response with file without redirect)
DONE : Change the update button to old css (icon ghost)
DONE : Add a component to the navbar, that shows every job ongoing (for current user).
DONE : Make the download button by case - If file present, download directly, if not, add to queue and do like right now.
DONE : Fix downloadmanager to get currently going jobs.
DONE : Add cron jobs for cleaning files (every 2 days or something)
DONE : Add a selector next to all platforms, to filter all local files, not downloaded file or all

DONE : Add multiple platforms. implement some kind of account manager thing.
DONE : Implement playlists fetch.
DONE : Fix the multiple playlists thing. Only one track must be shown, even if in multiple playlists.
DONE : Add a new selector for playlists.




TODO THINK : Spotify liked songs limit

DONE : Overhaul the populatesongsforuser method : accurate email, fix the youtube forbidden (scope probably), only get music.youtube.com playlists, etc...
REMOVED : Add true auth to the app : user need to create account or get created to access it, so that the user can have different emails for spotify and youtube, while having one email in the DB.
DONE : Add a column in the db and on relevant screens, that get the date of the song added to the playlist (not added to the app).

DONE : Add one click download for all not downloaded file (new-additions)



DONE : Remove the is-local api, only taken by the normal retrieval system.
DONE : Add a tool to set which songs were downloaded (as users could have downloaded songs elsewhere, we need to add the option to set which songs have been already downloaded. )

DONE : Add more options than "only my playlist", as for example "Radar des sorties" or "DÃ©couverte de la semaine" is taken into my playlist account.

DONE : Add a better tracking on the zipping (logs of progress, and enhance it to be faster.)

DONE : Also set the songs from batch download to download when download is done (click on button and served folder)

Treat the batch download songs into sub process. (5 songs by 5 songs in 5 process) -> makes the bulk dl faster
ABORTED : Add accurate metadata to file (right artist, right album name, ...)
DONE Add a file type options (flac, wav, kbps ) for songs.

Album art fetching and embedding

Scheduled Downloads
Set up automatic downloads at specific times
Periodic playlist synchronization

UI/UX Improvements
Responsive design for all screen sizes
Keyboard shortcuts for power users

ADD playlist download (either custom-url)

Bulk DL should be one CMD -> all url's passed as parameter directly. (WAY FASTER PROCESSING)
